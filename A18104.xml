            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader: this treatiſe came to my hande, and I have peruſed it, &amp; I ſaw it to be but a relation out of other ancient Hiſtories, how ſuperſtition was brought into the Church, which made me to wonder, that any, who is not a lover of popery, ſhould ſuppreſſe it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it doth only ſhewe what others have written, who lyved in thoſe ages wherein they were brought into the Church, I have therefore gott this treatiſe to be examined and viewed by ſundry others, who are not inferiour for giftes and learned artes to any who had a hand in ſuppreſſing this booke, and all of them doe agree with me that thoſe things which are related in it are to be found in the writtings of thoſe Authors quoted in it, therefore I take it that thoſe which ſuppreſſed it, if they be not Papiſts in their hearts, yet they hould with the Papiſts, that ignorance is the mother of devotion, which is expreſly againſt the Law of God. And the Scriptures hould ignorance to be no better then Paganiſme, therefore the Apoſtle doth tell us, that God ſhall come to judgment in flaming fyre rendring vengeance to all which knowe not God, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. Therefore thoſe which contemne this means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, much more they which ſuppreſſe the knowledge of God, or his truth, their end ſhalbe wofull and accurſed.</p>
            <p>Our adverſaries the Papiſts doe vanut much of antiquitie unto ſuch as are not acquainted in ancient Hiſtories, ſaying that their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the true religion of Chriſt, which hath bene in all ages ſince the Apoſtles: but this ſhort treatiſe doth manifeſt otherwiſe; if we ſearch the Scriptures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtories we may find that all their boaſting is mere deluſion, which doth vaniſh away, and their Religion ſhalbe found to be no other, then the Scriptures have foretould, to witt, that Antichriſt ſhould ariſe in the Church of God, and corrupt all the holy ordinances of God, &amp; ſett up his traditions, &amp; command them to be obſerved above all the ordinances of God. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.4. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11.12. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. And although they have ſuppreſſed the teſtimonies of the faithfull witneſſes of the truth, which we produce againſt them, yet we do find ſufficient teſtimonies out of their owne writers, that their religion was not receaved in many Churches till a thouſand yeares after our Lords aſcenſion, and ſince brought to the height by <hi>Jnnocentius</hi> the third and <hi>Honorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then by their owne Authors confeſſion, God did ſtirre up many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of wittneſſes to his truth which we profeſſe againſt their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="tcp:8021:3"/>&amp; in all ages ſince, the Lords truth hath not wanted ſome which did witneſſe it, even to the death, by giving their lives for it.</p>
            <p>And now this hundreth yeares the Lord hath given us in our land many excellent truthes to be maintained by lawes, to be profeſſed and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced which many thouſands have comfortably embraced, and are departed this life in Chriſt and reſt with him. And now for our great ſinnes the Lord doth beginne to take it away from our land, as he hath done in other countries which have had it, &amp; we ſee he hath ſent them the ſword with famine and great miſeries, and he hath ſhaken his rod againſt us, to ſee if we will learne before it be too late, and forſake all our great and haynous iniquities. Chriſt tould the Iewes that thoſe eighteene, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell, were examples to them, that except they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they ſhould all periſh; ſo except wee reforme our great and crying tranſgreſſions we ſhalbe ruinated and made an aſtoniſhment to all the world: and although we are not the firſt who have drunk of this cup of Gods wrath, yet we ſhall not receive the leaſt part, although the Lord have reſerved the Dregges of his cup for the beaſt and his falſe teachers.</p>
            <p>Wee may ſee the Angell of the Lord is executing of his wrath here, and all the world is in an uproare round about us. The whole frame of nature is out of order, yet wee do not lament as we ſhould, therefore it doth prognoſticate his plagues ſhall fall ſeven times heavier upon us. The goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt is departing from us, who can love his King and Country, and not lament &amp; mourne &amp; feare leaſt his fiere wrath ſhould conſume us all in this troubleſome, cruell, deſperate and bloodie age in which wee live, now that warres &amp; rumoures of warres are ſounding in every mans eares, and Gods enemies make Havocke of his Churches and Servants, and the Romane Antichriſt doth prevayle, &amp; Gods people at this day be grievouſly perſecuted and murdered, yea ſome conſumed and devoured. Alas it wilbe too late to bring water to quench the fyre, when the houſe is burnt to aſhes. This ſhort treatiſe is to manifeſt the originall of the ſuperſtitions crept into the Churches, how moſt of them came from the old heatheniſh Romanes, except their Tranſubſtantiation, which is a groſſer kind of Idolatrie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever was invented by any Pagane.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, if you doe obſerve this treatiſe, you may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſtop the mouthes of the Papiſts, and behold whence their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Maſſe is derived.</p>
            <p>I have in the end added ſome thing of my owne collecting, moſt out of their owne Authors, to ſhew the truth, how long it is ſince their idol of their Breaden God came firſt into the Church. S. O.</p>

            <p>Conſidering the Controverſies and bloudy hatred grown betwixt thoſe (who profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians) about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for they aſpiring to retain theſe vaine ſuperſtitions proceeding from their predeceſſors: and many alſo not contented, do invent new Sects, Schiſms and Hereſies: Others (leaſt in number) divinely inſpired, and of God elected, deſire to extirpate the Darkneſſe of Ignorance, thereby to cauſe reſplendently to ſhine, the Light, and claritie of Truth: But it ſeemes, that the moſt dangerous Poyſon that Satan uſeth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate men with the Venym of ſedition, and cruell contention and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, derives chiefly from the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> diſguiſed with ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, masked and covered (peradventure) with a good intention.

            <p>Therefore now, without any paſſion, I have faithfully extracted, and lively drawne out, from the Volumes of ELASOPOLITANS COMMENTARIES: (It is a large and faithfull deſcription; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſecond Volume treates of the Conſtitutions of great Pontiſs, Soveraigne Prieſts, and Sacrificers, as have been ordained ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, and their true Number, Power, Riches, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; (all for thy only benefit) this ſincere Summary of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Maſſe.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the time preordained of God by his inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and incomprehenſible Wiſedome, (when hee had created man to his true Image and likeneſſe, the better to move and incite him to feare and obedience, as alſo to make him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his bleſſings, he gave him ſme exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vertue whereby hee might acknowledge him his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8021:6"/>God, and omnipotent Creatour) were ordained many <hi>Signes, Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments:</hi> Firſt, to our firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom with his Succeſſors, corporall men, God allotted corporall ſignes, to approve the better of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: to wit, trees planted in the middeſt of the Orchard, &amp; earthly Paradiſe: which although they were not of any other qualitie then the other plants, yet notwithſtanding being dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated of God for Sacraments, or Sacred Signes, their qualitie was then for to ſerve as Seales for the Teſtimonie and approbation of his divine will and pleaſure, which was effected by the infinite goodneſſe &amp; bounty of God, to make appeare and knowne, that the Aſſociation, Confederation and alliance contracted with man his Creature, was ordained from time to time, yea from the beginning of all times: Thus, I ſay, were exteriour and Corporall Signes, which man could ſee and contemplate with his Corporall Eyes, conſtituted to ſerve for an aſſurance, pledge, and hoſtage of the Divine Covenant.</p>
               <p>Theſe Trees and ſubſtantiall Fruits ordained for our firſt and common Father, were committed and given unto him to keepe, without waſting either, or eating of the one, upon paine of eternall death. Wherefore wee muſt in faith beleeve, that they were not vaine Signes and Sacraments, or as a meere ſimple Picture: but whereas life or death depended on them, they comprehended both the ſignes and thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; wherein conſiſted the knowledge and wiſedom to feare God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2.3</note> and obey him. And therefore they were called the Fruits of the knowledge of good and ill, &amp; the Trees of life; For in the carefull keeping of theſe ſacred fruits, and obeying God, there was promiſed eternall life: whereas on the contrary, by abuſing the Sacraments, and oppoſing the will of God, there was intimated to us by exteriour ſignes, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death and damnation was purchaſed.</p>
               <p>For other exerciſes required of man towards God,<note place="margin">Sacrifices before the written Law.</note> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reverence, honor and adoration of him, many &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Sacrifices were celebrated, even before the Law, written by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And though God Almighty, Creatour of Heaven
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8021:6"/>and Earth, needs not any humane workes, or to bee nouriſhed with the bloud of beaſts, or with terreſtriall fruits,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>50.</hi>
                  </note> yet hee had allwayes a deſire to draw man unto him, in an externall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and feare, by Signes, Sacrifices, and Sacraments: ſo as the Sacrifice of Lambes, offered by <hi>Abel,</hi> were agreable and pleaſing to God. <hi>Noah</hi> in like manner, after the inundation of waters paſt, in ſigne of his recognition and obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, erected an Altar,<note place="margin">

By which examples we may eaſily diſcerne, that Sacrifices tooke not their beginning in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, but that Innocent and Iuſt Lambe was prefigured in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> Sacrifice, as a type of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> ſlaine and offered from the beginning of the world.<note place="margin">Apoc. <hi>13.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the yeere of the world 2048.</note> there was another confederation &amp; alliance contracted by the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, who, for a pledge and aſſurance to him and his poſterity, conſtituted the externall ſigne of Circumciſion, to ſerve him for a Sacrament, &amp; a perpetuall notice of Gods holy will and pleaſure: and ſo he was enjoyned to circumciſe the male infants within the eighth day of their nativitie, upon paine of being rejected from the number of thoſe people whom God had adopted.<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>17.</hi>

               <p>Then followed to his poſterity afterward, called the people of Iſrael, the ſacrifice of the immaculate Lambe, which was ordain'd by the ſhedding of bloud, to preſerve them from

               </p>
               <p>Other ſacred ſignes were ſent by God to his Elect people, to winne them continually to his feare and obedience: as the ſigne of the Cloud,<note place="margin">The Cloud.

               <p>Now during the time that this elect people of God were detained in the Arabian Deſarts,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.</note> and barren Wildernes, they had proviſion of heavenly bread, wherewith they were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for fortie yeeres, which was alſo an holy Sacrament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the power and will of God,<note place="margin">Heavenly Manna. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> and held in ſo high an admiration, that each one amongſt the people ſaid, Man-hu, what a wonderfull thing is this?

Some were Holocauſts, being Sacrifices that were wholly conſumed with fire: Others conſiſted of beaſts ſlaine and immolated to eate, there were earthly and ayerie Creatures. Amongſt thoſe terreſtriall,<note place="margin">Diviſion of ſacrifices, extracted out of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> Beaſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſacrifice.</note> were the moſt obedient and obſequious beaſts; as the Oxe and the Calfe, the Hee, and Shee Goat: and ſo likewiſe amongſt Fowle, the moſt mild and gentle; as the Pidgeon, and Turtle.</p>
               <p>Of Sacrifices againe, ſome were publike, and others pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or particular: thoſe publike were either quotidian or every ſeventh day, either at New Moones, or in times of Faſting: but they were chiefely celebrated at three feſtivall times of the yeere which were:

                        </note> They were commanded to immolate every day two Lambes; one in the morning, another in the evening, after the Altar was firſt perfumed, with Incenſe and Odours.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the Sacrifices alſo were ordain'd,<note place="margin">See the books of <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew, and of <hi>Ioſephus.</hi>
                  </note> for corporall things, which were celebrated with ſhedding of bloud, other ſacrifices were without bloud for things incorporate. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices named Holocauſts concerned onely the honour of God, becauſe the whole oblation was conſum'd in the fire. For which Holocauſts, the Male, and not the Female was received
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8021:8"/>as an oblation,<note place="margin">Holocauſt: <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew in his Treatiſe of Beaſts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſacrifice. <hi>Ioſeph. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>De Antiq.

               <p>There was another difference betweene the Sacrifice for Health, and that celebrated for ſinne: for in the one, they were injoyn'd to eate up all the oblation in two dayes; and in the other for ſinne, the Prieſt was commanded to eate it up in one day: and by this meanes ſome Sacrifices were termed Holocauſts:<note n="a" place="margin">Sacrifices for ſinne.

               <p>Sacrifices for ſinne were divers, both in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and of the oblations.</p>
               <p>For he that offended out of ignorance, his expiation was celebrated with a female Sheepe or Goat: but the expiation for voluntary and wilfull ſinne, was with a Male ſheepe.</p>
               <p>The High Prieſts ſinne was expiated by the ſacrifice of an immolated Calfe: that of the Prince with an Hee Goat, or Bull: that of a Magiſtrate, with an Hee Goat; and the ſinne of a particular man, with a female oblation.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifice for expiation of offences towards God, was with a Ramme.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifice of a man polluted, was alſo with a female Sheepe or Goat: &amp; for a womans expiation after child-bed, was a Lambe of a yeere old, a yong Pidgeon, and a Turtle.</p>
               <p>For the clenſing of the Leprous, were appointed two living Fowles, pure and cleane, Cedar-wood, and Hyſop, two whole Lambes, and a female ſheepe of a yeere old, with Meale and Oyle.</p>
               <p>Another Sacrifice was celebrated for a man or woman pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, by ſhedding his Seed, or her menſtruall bloud; with two Turtles, and two yong Pigeons.</p>
               <p>If the great Oblations failed, they had recourſe to Doves, Pigeons, or Turtles, or for Holocauſts: others, maintenance.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8021:8"/>
               <p>In all Sacrifices there was pure Flowre, without Leaven,<note place="margin">Leaven and Honey for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in all ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>Notwithſtanding in the Sacrifice conſtituted for the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a woman ſuſpected of Adulterie, there was neither Incenſe, nor Oyle, as in other Sacrifices; but it was offered with water, mingled with the duſt, or aſhes, gathered up from the floore of the Temple.</p>
               <p>There was alſo another Sacrifice, celebrated for thoſe that had made ſome great Vow, called <hi>Nazareans,</hi> when the time of their Devotion was expired, wherein they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to offer three Victimes, a Lambe of a yeere old, a Sheepe, and a Ramme: the one, that is, the Lambe, to ſerve for a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſt: the other, of a female Sheepe, for Salvation, and the third oblation for Health. Furthermore, his haires that made the oblation, were to be caſt into the fire, to be burned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Holocauſt.</p>
               <p>I was willing particularly to diſcourſe of the diverſitie of Sacrifices, that hereby I might make knowne the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bounty of our God: who in the Law of ſacrifices, publiſht by <hi>Moſes,</hi> meant to curbe and reyne in the rude people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it were with a Bridle, who could not forget the Aegypt an Idolatries, wherein they had beene nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and bred, for about foure hundred yeeres, under the tyranny of the <hi>Pharaohs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> But what rigorous Lawes ſoever enacted: what Ceremonies or Sacrifices ſoever he did ordaine them: this people ever made a relapſe into their Idolatry, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Law of God, and corrupting the holy Sacraments, and ſacrifices, as hereafter ſhall be expreſſed. But if any man deſire to know more at large, the multitude and varietie of ſacrifices: let him reade the bookes of <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew; and of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his Antiquities of the Iewes, according as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath expreſſely written in the bookes of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Numbers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another ſigne &amp; Sacrament inſtituted of God,<note place="margin">Arke of Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.26.27.28.</note> by the Arke of Covenant, deſcribed in <hi>Exodus,</hi> being a ſacred ſigne, and dedicated to receive celeſtiall divine Oracles, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8021:9"/>the end to induce the people to a remembrance, feare, &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God. To accompany and honour the Arke of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, many other externall ſignes were conſtituted by God, as the ornaments and conſecrations of the Prieſts; eſpecially that ornament called the <hi>Ephod:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephod.</note> both which and the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Iſraelites abuſed and prophaned with their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>

               <p>AFter that the inſcrutable Wiſedome of God knew the obſtinacie and infidelity of the Iſraelitiſh people, which perſevered ſtill in committing Idolatrie, by corrupting the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſignes, ſacraments, &amp; ſacrifices; and in ſtead of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Gods infinite goodneſſe, that had freed them from the tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and fedde them in the Deſart; who had brought them into a promiſed fertile Land, and had ſo many times aſſiſted them in the warres, againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the Canaanites, Moabites, Madianites, Philiſtines, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites, Syrians, Sydomans, and other envious people, and enemies: This rude and ingratefull people continued ſtill in their Idolatry, inſtructed by their Prieſts, ſacrificers, Princes, &amp; Kings, without returning to the true adoration of one onely God: For this cauſe, after great mercies ſhewed, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Iuſt and rigorous Iudge, who by all courſes of correction was deſirous to reduce his people by divine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inflictions; which was, by excited wars, by captivities, &amp; ſervitudes, by diviſions of the Kingdom, diſtributed between <hi>Roboam</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> ſucceſſours to <hi>Salomon.</hi> who fell to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Idolatry, by inteſtine and civill warres, growing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſame people, divided in themſelves, and by other uſuall ſcourges, to chaſtize thoſe whom God meant to favour, for the reducing of them under his feare and obedience. At laſt, this people beeing too much obdurate, and inveterated in their Idolatries, were brought into miſerable ſervitude under the Tyranny of the unbeleeving Aſſyrians,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.24.</note> the Idolatrous Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, and their Kingdomes wholly extirpated.</p>
               <p>But ſome pretty while after, when the ſame people by the ſpeciall mercy of God, were delivered out of the hands of theſe infidell Tyrants, reſtored to their liberty, and Countrey
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8021:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>of promiſe, they againe fell from God more then before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of their ſacrificers &amp; high Prieſts, which confounded the Spirituall and Temporall together, ſo farre as to inveſt themſelves with the Royall Scepter, and Diadem.</p>
               <p>Then came in the Hereſies of the Phariſees, the Sadducees,<note place="margin">Ioſeph. lib. <hi>13</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi> de Aut.

               <p>WEe may evidently diſcerne by this ſuccinct diſcourſe, how weake and mutable man is, ever abuſing &amp; alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the graces of God.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8021:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>God by Ieſus Chriſt, having conſituted a forme of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating his Body and Bloud, under the ſymboles and ſacred ſignes of Bread and Wine: which holy Sacrament began to bee alienated,<note place="margin">Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> even in the very times of the Apoſtles, by the Corinthians; againſt whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote Epiſtles, to reduce them to the ſincere and true obſervation of this holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let no man hereafter thinke it ſtrange, if the Apoſtles ſucceſſors have from time to time adulterated the true Vſe and Rite of this holy Sacrament; and the further off they were in the preſent age of their living, from the time of the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt, the more eaſily they fell into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; yea, ſuch as were moſt abominable; having converted the ſincere Vſe of this Sacrament, into a Gulph and Precipice of all Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccl.</note> what an alteration happened in the Church, next and immediatly ſucceeding the Apoſtles, touching a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of dayes, when this holy Sacrament was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sabatius</hi> the Heretike inſtituted the celebration of the Paſſeover,<note place="margin">Hist. tripart. lib. <hi>9.</hi> ca. <hi>37.</hi> &amp; lib. <hi>11.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> Enſeb. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> with unleavened bread, after the manner of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Some of his ſect ordained, that this holy Sacrament ſhould bee ſolemnized the fourteenth daye of Moneth, as the Iewes did. <hi>Policrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hist. tripart. lib <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>38</hi> &amp; <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> Biſhop of the Epheſians, was ſaid to bee of this ſect; <hi>Philip Hiropolitan, Policarpus, Truſcas, Melitus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Narciſsus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem; Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Eleutherius</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, &amp; <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Palestina</hi> were of a contrary opinion. This difference continued for more then three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres after the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>Others celebrated the Paſſeover after the Aequinoctiall ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when the ſunne entred into the ſigne of <hi>Aries:</hi> and others obſerved the Moneth <hi>Xanthicke,</hi> called by the Romanes, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill.</hi> Some affirmed for example the Quartodecumans, how they were informed by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> to celebrate it in the fourteenth day of the Moneth.</p>
               <p>The Romanes vaunted that they were taught by <hi>S. Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:8021:18"/>and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> whereof notwithſtanding no manifeſt proofe appeared. The Phrygian Montaniſts condemne the Quarto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decumans, which obſerved the fourteenth day of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; and that they ought herein to bee governed by the courſe of the ſunne, and ſo to begin it at the ſprings <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall:</hi> And for this reaſon they celebrated it the eight of the Ides of <hi>Aprill,</hi> which was the fourteenth of the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, though it fell upon a Sunday.</p>
               <p>And there was not a contention onely touching the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of this holy Sacrament,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>5.</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> on the ſeverall dayes aſſigned for celebrating thereof: but there was likewiſe a notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion among the Chriſtians, about the Ceremonies invented, whereby worthily to receive the ſame. For ſome, as in particular, the <hi>Romanes,</hi> obſerved the Faſt, or Euen, three weekes before the day it ſelfe of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and all <hi>Greece,</hi> as likewiſe the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> inſtituted a Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſima, to faſt for ſixe weekes. Some others ordained a ſeven weekes abſtinence, with an Intermiſſion from five to five dayes.</p>
               <p>Then was another Iewiſh Ceremonie reſtored,<note place="margin">Hist. Tripar. cap. <hi>38.</hi>
                  </note> the more to corrupt the holy Sacrament of the Supper, through differece and diſtinction of meats. For ſome prohibited during the Feaſt, the eating either of Fiſh, or Fleſh: Others forbade the uſe of Fleſh onely, permitting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eate Fiſh, or Fowle; which they ſaid, according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> did participate of the ſubſtance of the Water. Some in like manner ordained, that men ſhould only eate bread and water: Others faſted till noone, without any diſtinction of meates. And to reſolve briefly: there was in the beginning, an infinite number of Corruptions and Cuſtomes, in the Communion of the holy Sacrament of the Supper, by meanes of the Ceremonies renewed, about diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of dayes and meated, abrogated by the Grace and Law of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But was there any holy Apoſtle of God,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>2.</hi> Galat. <hi>4.</hi> Heb. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> that ever left in writing any Law or Commandement, for diſtinction of dayes and meates, in celebrating the holy Supper of Ieſus Chriſt? Their intention was not to inſtitute a Religion of Feaſts, a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8021:19"/>diſtinction of dayes and meates: Their Doctrine onely aimed to inſtruct men how to live well; and that onely God was to be adored and worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, we muſt neceſſarily hereupon inferre, that the Ceremony and Feſtivity of the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> or Eaſter, proceeded from a cuſtome; for none of the Apoſtles left any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in writing.</p>
               <p>To qualifie ſuch Diſſentions and Corruptions, many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were aſſembled;<note place="margin">Hist Tripar. lib. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>38</hi>

               <p>To bring in another odious corruption, the Meſſalians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in their Miſſal-Idolatries, to ſacrifice and offer the Body and Bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, reiterating by this means the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8021:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſacrifice fully conſummated by Ieſus Chriſt, which cannot bee reiterated, becauſe it was, not according to the forme of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> the Eternall Sacrifizer and Prieſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving any ſucceſſor.

               <p>The beginning of the Supper, was not to kill or immolate, or to ſacrifice any beaſt, or oblation to God; but onely to eate and drinke at his holy banquet, prepared for us by Ieſus Chriſt, the Eternall ſacrifice, and ſacrificer; who reſerved onely for himſelfe this Eternall Prieſthood; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, hee left unto us a ſacred Inſtitution of a banquet, ſet before us in the Bread &amp; Wine, which repreſent his Body and Bloud.</p>

               <p>All of them, as well as my ſelfe, will confeſſe, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romane Religion was either wholly, or for the greateſt part inſtituted by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the ſecond King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, about ſeven hundred yeeres before the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Titivill. lib. <hi>1.</hi> deca. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> Then were your high Prieſts inveſted, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were reduced to a certaine number, even to foure: then the number was augmented to eight: and afterwards by <hi>Silla</hi> to fifteene.</p>
               <p>In the Colledge of Prieſts,<note place="margin">Ecuestell. lib. de Magist.

               <p>This <hi>Pompilian</hi> Relig on was ſo religiouſly obſerved by the Romanes from father to ſonne, as it was never poſſible to irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, or ſupplant it: but it continues even to this day, as every one ſhall manifeſtly diſcerne by this ſuccinct Narration.</p>
               <p>To confirme this point, no man can be ignorant, if ever he read the Romane Hiſtories; but that, before the Incarnation of Chriſt, there was not ſo much as one King, Confull, Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Romane Emperour, inſtructed in the Law of God, but all were Idolaters and Infidels, obſerving the Religion of that Magician, <hi>Numa Pompvius.</hi> For ſince the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt, for the ſpace of three hundred yeeres, or thereabouts, there was not likewiſe any Emperour,<note place="margin">

Some had their braines troubled to deviſe Feaſts of dedication, and Conſecration with Exorciſmes, to drive away devils with ſalt: and otherſome to invent Oyles and Vnctions, wherewith to corrupt the holy Sacrament of Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Then afterward during the time of theſe tyrant Emperours, &amp; great Pontifes, the Biſhops of Rome, deſiring to perpetuate their names, they wore out their braines in building of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8021:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Author of the Romane Religion <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> never thought of the Hebrewes, when he firſt inſtituted the Maſſe: neither can this word <hi>Miſſa,</hi> or <hi>Meſse,</hi> take originall from the Greekes. Becauſe there is no ſacrifice of this name or title, though ſome have brought in a colourable reaſon from this Greeke word <hi>Myzein,</hi> which is to ſay in French; to hide or keepe in ſecret: as if the <hi>Meſſalian</hi> Sacrificers received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auncient idolatrous Greekes, to mumble ſecretly the principall words of their Maſſes, that the Auditors might not heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but they uſed to murmur &amp; whiſper betwixt the teeth, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, &amp; ſome ſpeciall words, which neither themſelves, nor they that looke on underſtand.

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration and exorciſme inſtituted by <hi>Numa,</hi> was of Sea or ſalt water, becauſe (ſaid he) ſalt did participate of the fierie Nature, or of Fire, very proper to purifie. For this reaſon, the Ancient Romane Idolaters, beſprinckled this ſalt exorciſed water, as a Mercuriall expiatorie &amp; Purgatory water for popular offences, eſpecially for perjurie and lying.</p>
               <p>To preſerve this conſecrated, and exorciz'd ſalt Water, they had two ſorts of Holy water Fonts: One was large not move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but placed at the entrie of their Temples, where they adored their Images, that ſo they might ſprinckle thoſe which entred into the ſame Temples. The other was a portable Font, to conveigh therein Luſtrall water into any part of their Temples or houſes, that they might be watered with it, for their expiations, and purifications. They that were to celebrate Maſſe, if it were to the inferiour gods, it was enough for the ſacrificing Prieſt to ſprinckle himſelfe with that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrall water. But if the Prieſt celebrated Maſſe, to the ſuperiour gods, hee muſt bathe his whole body, and waſh all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therewith.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he was prohibited, not to uſe this Luſtrall water for any other purpoſe, but for expiations, &amp; purgations.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the firſt of that name, next ſucceſſor to the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt, and one of the firſt corrupters of the holy Sacraments ordained by God, continued this Idolatrie, of conſecrating &amp; exerciſing Luſtrall water with ſalt, to repell devils. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the better to maske Pompilian Magicke, he framed this compariſon: ſo it is, ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the aſhes of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violated red Cow for ſacrifice, mingled with Fountaine water, purified the people of the Iewes, and therefore by a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent reaſon, water exorzed with ſalt, muſt needs purifie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and drive away devils.</p>
               <p>Was not this a violating, and corrupting of the holy Law of God, to content and pleaſe the Romaines, tainted with the auncient religion of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the Magician? If <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had not yeelded to the uſe of ſalt, inſtituted by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Idolaters for luſtrall water, he would rather have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iewiſh ceremonie, and ordained Aſhes to conſecrate the water of expiation. For if he thought to diſguiſe it by the Miracle of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> that purified the water with ſalt, <hi>Moyſes</hi> alſo did the like, with the wood which was brought him, when the people of Iſrael were diſtreſſed for ſweet water to drinke. But in theſe miracles no mention is made, that <hi>Elizeus</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtituted any luſtrall water to purifie the people of the Iewes. And we cannot finde, that there was ever any luſtrall water amongſt the Iewiſh ceremonies, but only with Aſhes of the victime offered for ſacrifice. And therefore <hi>Alexander</hi> &amp; his followers muſt needs acknowledge, that the invention of ſalt water exorcized for the remiſſion of ſinnes, tooke origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> more then 700. yeares before the Incarnation of Chriſt. This luſtrall water was ſo religiouſly obſerved by the Romane Idolaters, that more then 360. yeares after the Incarnation of Chriſt, it is related how <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour entring in to the Temple of the Goddeſſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8021:29"/>the Prieſt with his Aſperges in his hand, alleaging how twas rather defiled then purified.</p>
               <p>By theſe true Hiſtories the Miſſalians may boaſt, that the firſt part of their Miſſall ſacrifice is very auncient indeed; and that their holy-water Fonts, and their luſtrall ſalt waters of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceed from the auncient doctrine of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> but not from the Euangelicall doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, which they tearme a new Doctrine,<note place="margin">Sait holy water very auncient.</note> and the New Teſtament differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ancient Iewiſh ceremonies, and heathen idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

A forme Inſtituted by <hi>Numa</hi> to goe on Proceſſion, either to appeaſe the wrath of the gods, to obtaine peace, or to pray unto God for the fruits of the earth; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was in this manner: Firſt before the Proceſſion walkt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine young children, then the ſacrificing Prieſts clad in white Surpleſſes, ſinging Hymnes, Paeans, &amp; Canticles to the honour of their gods. Then marched the high Prieſt, or <hi>Curio:</hi> Then marched the Romane Senators, with their wives and children: and ſometimes the common people aſſiſted. There was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly carried about in Proceſſion, the Shrine or Reliquarie of god <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or of <hi>Anubis,</hi> by ſome Prieſts clad in white Surpleſes, with ſhaven heads, and thereon wearing crownes. This Crowne was of ſuch reverence &amp; eſteeme, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himſelfe <hi>Commodus Antonius</hi> high Pontifex, cauſed his head to be ſhaven and cut round, expreſſely to carry the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of god <hi>Anubis.</hi> Before the Cabinet or Reliquarie, went a Cierger, carrying a light taper in his hand. When the Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion went along through the ſtreets, there were ſeats erected, to ſerve for ſtations or places, where the Prieſts, which caried the relicks were apointed to reſt and take breath. When the Proceſſion was ended, the Temples were opened, the Altars and Images perfumed with Inſence, and the Reliquies of their gods ſhewed. On thoſe dayes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went abroad, a Feaſt was celebrated, the ſhops were cloſde up, the Hall of Iuſtice ſhut in, and the priſonners unſhackled: who can better diſcipher the order of Proceſſions obſerved even at this day, by the Miſſalians Inſtructed from father to ſonne in the Pompilian Religion. What other Author can be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged touching the Ceremonies performed in Proceſſion, except <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> himſelfe? If the Miſſalians ſought not out further, for their crowned ſhaven crownes, and white Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8021:31"/>which the ancient Aegiptian Idolaters were wont to vſe: the Prieſts of the Goddeſſe <hi>Iſis,</hi> or the Babilonian ſacrificers, wearing their heads &amp; beards ſhaven. As for the Law of God, the contrary therein was obſerved, and the ſacrificing Prieſts were forbidden, to cut their heads or haire round, &amp; to ſhave their heads. And as for the Law of the Goſpel, there is no ſuch like ceremony commanded by Ieſus Chriſt, nor by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: they muſt therefore needs proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ancient Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilian Religion. For other things in the Proceſſion, they have added the carrying of the Croſſe or Banner: this Banner was tearmed by the ancient Romane Idolaters <hi>Labarum:</hi> which was reputed a ſacred enſigne, ſo much revered by the Dictators &amp; Emperours, as alſo by the ſouldiers that went to the wars. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> firſt pictured in that Banner a Sow, by reaſon of the name <hi>Troja,</hi> which in the vulgar Italian tongue ſignifies a Sow: which enſigne <hi>Antenor</hi> vowed and dedicated in the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi>

                  <hi>In</hi> Titelmans <hi>Alcoran, the incenſe is interpreted for the prayer of the Maſſe-priest, that it may mount up into heaven with the odour of ſwavity: even as the fume of incenſe ſteames up on high.

                  </note> Their ſecond revenue or emolument, grew by offertories, offerings or oblations. The third reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue conſiſted of annuall meanes and contributions, as the firſt yeares fruits, which the idolatrous Romane Pontifes were wont to take, for the vacancy of benefices in their gift, or that they ſold, and diſpenſed with. The fourth revennue grew from obſequies, anniverſaries, legacies, and donatives confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to pray to their gods for the ſoules of the deceaſed. All which is verified likewiſe at this day, by the monuments and ſepulchres of the ancient idolaters. The fift revennue came in by amercements, condemnations, and confiſcations, which were adjudged by the Romane Pontifes: As <hi>Ciceroes</hi> houſe &amp; palace when he was baniſhed, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiſcated to the Colledge pontificall: and ſpecially alloted for ſacrifices to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Temple conſecrated to the goddeſſe <hi>Liberty.</hi> I was deſirous by the way, briefly to recite the revennues and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations of the ancient Romane ſacrificers, to the end that men might more and more diſcerne that all abuſes and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſucceeding in the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, are not new; but originally derived or revived from the ancient Romane idolaters, as the foundation of Maſſes, Obits, Anniverſaries, Diſpenſations for holding ſundry benefices, penſions, vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, firſt-fruits, offerings, and the Miſſalian treaſure, all amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and confiſcations adjudged within the demeans of the Romane Pontife, with other ordinances revived by new Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Popes, which have diſcended from one to another. To this purpoſe wee reade in the Romane Stories, that during the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> the ſecond of this name, there hapned a dangerous ſedition at Rome, betweene the Chriſtian &amp; idolatrous Prieſts, which ſtrove who ſhould amaſſe or heape up together moſt wealth in the Church by grants, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary legacies, oblations and other inventions: ſo as the Heathen and Infidell idolaters, who retained yet a Temple to themſelves, called at this day the Church of Saint <hi>Peter ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> fought with the Chriſtians at Rome, who would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it to their devotion.</p>

                     </note> but men were appointed to eate and communicate within the Temple, after the end of the Miſſall Sacrifice, ſmall round loaves conſecrated to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the gods, in whoſe name the ſacrifice was celebrated. Theſe little round hoſts of fine meale, were earen by the Prieſt, and by the aſſiſtants, ſtanding upright, and not ſitting. The flower wherof they were made, was called</hi> Mola, <hi>and from thence came this word</hi> immolare. <hi>There were divers hoſts, that is to ſay; little round loaves dedicated to divers gods, as there were likewiſe ſundry Miſſall Sacrifices. With the ſaid round hoſts they alſo offered Wine: the Altars ſerving for Tables.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8021:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>to the honor of their gods, hymnes and thankſgivings were ſung, and ſome uſed the ſound of the Organs and Cymbals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before the ſwallowing of this round hoſt, printed with imagery, the Miſſalian Doctors ordained the Prieſt, to utter certaine exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes, and conjurations, with many ſignes of the croſſe. Firſt, hee muſt make three croſſes upon this round hoſt, to figure the trinall tradition of Chriſt; that is to ſay, by the Father, by himſelfe Chriſt, and by the holy Ghoſt, in pronouncing theſe words; <hi>Haec dona, haec munera, haec ſancta ſacrificia illibata.</hi> Some other Doctors Alcoraniſts and Miſsalians interpret the third croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for <hi>Iudas</hi> treaſon, who delivered his Master into the hands of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Beſides the above mentioned three Croiſadoes, five other follow: to intimate the five dayes ſpace from the day of Palmes, to the day of the Paſſion, or otherwiſe to repreſent the five wounds of Chriſt; two in the hands, two in the feet, and one in the right ſide. Of which five Croyſadoes, the three firſt muſt be made over the Chalice, and the round host; to figure the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Christ to the Priests, Scribes and Phariſies, or to ſignifie the price of Chriſts ſale, that is to ſay, three times ten, which import the thirty pence. The two other croſſings are made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; on which is the fourth over the hoſt, &amp; the other over the Chalice, diſtinctly to manifeſt unto us the two perſons, of Christ &amp; Iudas: when this is done, the Maſse-Prieſt continuing in his fooleries &amp; monckeries, ſtretcheth out his armes, to delineate Chriſt ſpred upon the Croſſe: then, he lifts the round hoſt printed with imagery on high, that it may be adored: Afterwards, he returnes to make three croſſes; one over the host, another over the Chalice, and third over himſelfe: to play herein the part of three estates or conditions of thoſe that are in Heaven, in Purgatory, and in the earth. Then he thumps upon his breſt, to play the penitent theefe that was hanged upon the Croſſe. This thumping of his ſtomacke muſt bee performed with the three laſt fingers of his hand, becauſe the thumbe and the next finger are reſerved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and tranſubſtantiate the round hoſt. Moreover, he muſt beat his breaſt three times, to figure a triple offence, of the heart, of the mouth, and of reall act; exalting his voice, to repreſent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8021:36"/>the Theefe or the Centurion which confeſsed God in the Paſſion. Sixe other Croiſadoes are afterwards reiterated, three over the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Chalice, to commemorate the three houres that Chriſt hung alive upon the Croſſe; and three other croſses are made over the open Chalice, and the round host, being once more elevated, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher the three houres, that Chriſt hung dead upon the Croſſe. Then does he adde two other croſses, after the Maſse-monger hath kiſt his Chalice, to deſcribe the mystery of blood and water iſsuing out of Chriſts ſides. Beſides all the above mentioned mute mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meries, the Prieſt muſt lift the vaile over the Chalice, and releaſe it from Plataine, to repreſent the rent vaile in the midſt, at Chriſts death. This being done, the round hoſt is laid upon the Chalice, and couched in the corporall, to figure the burial of Chriſt. When the Maſſe Prieſt hath plaid the part of the hang'd theefe, of the traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> of Chriſt, of the Publicanes, hee afterwards comoediates the Centurion, ſinging the Pater Noster. But <hi>Durandus Alcoran,</hi> by the petitions in the Pater Noſter, expreſſeth the ſeven teares of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the ſeven ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; or the ſeven mortall ſinnes. When this ſong is ended, the Prieſt remaines ſilent for a while, to repreſent the ſilence &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Chriſt in the grave. Another apery or Monckery is plaid by the Maſſe Prieſt, with the round hoſt, which hee laies upon the Pix to decypher the union of his divinity, with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: but when he plaies the ſecret myſtery, the hoſt is hidden out of ſight.</p>

               <p>Theſe little round Hoſts of wheat floure were taken by the Miſſalian ſacrificers,<note place="margin">Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> but they have augmented the magicke &amp; idolatry of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> in that they beautify their little round Hoſts with pictures and images printed within the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundity of the ſaid Hoſts, to make them the more ſacred, yea that they may bee adored, out of <hi>Honorius</hi> invention a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Antichriſt, reighing in the yeare of Chriſts incarnation 1226. which <hi>Numa</hi> the Magician never practiſed before, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grow to this abominable idolatry: what more deteſtable hereſie can be laid open, then to paint the Majeſtie of God in the forme of humane ſimilitude as the Anthropomorphites did?<note place="margin">Againſt the idolatry of round Hoſts.</note> Who taught you, O Miſſalians, to corrupt the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper of Ieſus Chriſt, in deviſing theſe little round loaves and Hoſts, but the Magician <hi>Numa?</hi> When Ieſus Chriſt celebrated the holy Supper with his Apoſtles, did he appoint them to have little loaves or round Hoſts, to print them with humane characters and effigies, to conjure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſe them with croſſes and croyſadoes in equall or unequall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8021:40"/>numbers, and cauſe them to bee adored? Confeſſe therefore, O Miſſalians, that the principall part of your Maſſe, that is, your little round hoſts, to be originall from the ancient Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilian Religion, more then ſeven hundred yeares before the Incarnation of Ieſus Chriſt; who did not inſtitute for you theſe rotundall hoſts, or that they ſhould bee rather round the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſquare, tryangle or octangle: ſo farre hee was from ordaining the round figure correſpondent to <hi>Numaes</hi> forme, that on the contrary, when he inſtituted the Sacrament of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his body, he uſed a fraction of bread by morſels, which he diſtributed to his Apoſtles, for a Symbole, ſigne, and figure, ſignifying ſacramentally his body by the power of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And the Miſſalians have not only made choice of the round forme in then conſecrated hoſts, printed with Images, to make them be adoted after the manner of the ancient Romans: but moreover they have exceeded all other Idolaters. For in the dayes of <hi>Numa</hi> and his fucceſſors, thoſe that were preſent at the Miſſail ſacrifice, eate ſtanding together the ſaid little round conſecrated hoſts, they uſing no charity towards them that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Miſſall ſacrifices?</p>
               <p>Is this to follow the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, who brake the bread and diſtributed it to his Apoſtles? Ieſus Chriſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Prieſt, ſtood he alone neere to an altar, munching a little round Hoſt, printed with Images, when he celebrated the holy communion of his body. O you Miſſalians, more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and leſſe charitable Idolaters, then all the other ancient Romanes, can you ſo ſophiſticate &amp; juggle, as to procure your Miſſal ſacrifice (wherein the Prieſt alone devoures the little round printed Hoſt with Images, giving no ſhare of it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) to be taken and received as a communion, cauſing them that are preſent at your Maſſe by an admirable Magicke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that they have communicated together with the Prieſt, though they neither eate, nor receive any portion of the round Hoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet further, for a more extreame Idolatry, the Miſſalian
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8021:41"/>Doctors Interpreters informe, that the round Hoſt muſt be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three parts, one for thoſe that are in Paradiſe, another for thoſe that are in Purgatory, to obtaine remiſſion of their ſinnes, and a third ſteept in wine, for thoſe that are living in the world. But</hi> Durands <hi>Alcoranſets downe, that the three broken portions of the Hoſt, repreſents the triple forme of Chriſts body, ſleeping in the grave, lying on the earth, and afterwards raiſed up from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Biel <hi>another ſubtil Doctor, not to confeſſe the body of Christ to be broken or bruiſed in the round host, deviſeth the fraction of the Hoſt to be made of an accident without ſubſtance. Are not theſe abhominable Hereſies, to make ſouies that are in Paradiſe, or Purgatory communicate: inſtituted by</hi> Sergius <hi>a Mahumetan Doctor, by the meanes of a round Hoſt devoured by the Maſſe-Prieſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But peradventure (Miſſalians) you may object unto me, the uſe of the Primative Church obſerved in the Communion of the holy Supper, where every one of the aſſembly in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tooke a portion of the broken bread; being alſo conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eate, and communicate together: which cuſtome was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till this preſent day, in your Miſſall ſacrifices, celebrated on Sundayes,<note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy bread. A notable difference betweene round con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated hoſts and holy bread.</note> which you cauſe to bee diſtributed of morſels of holy bread to thoſe preſent within the Temple. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient commandement, was maintained onely in picture; becauſe the Miſſalians abuſing the holy Sacrament, have reſerved the round little conſecrated Hoſt to be eaten by themſelves, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting no portion of it to the aſſiſtants: for whom they leave morſels of holy bread, which for the moſt part were foure ſquare.</p>
               <p>The round Hoſt is azimall, and the holy bread made with leven: the round Hoſt is without ſalt, and the holy bread ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned: the round Hoſt is printed with Images, and the holy bread is without characters or effigies: the round Hoſt is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the holy bread received with thankſgiving: the round Hoſt is devoured by the Prieſt, and the holy bread diſtributed to every one of the Aſſembly, to communicate &amp; eate thereof:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8021:41"/>the round Hoſt is in part ſteeped in wine, and the holy bread is eaten dry without wine.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there is ſo great a difference betweene theſe two ſeverall Communions, as there is betweene the law of the ancient Idolaters, &amp; the Law Euangelicall: but that they jumpe in one point: which is that both in the one, and the other, there is a corruption of the holy ſacrament of the ſupper ordained by God.</p>

                  </note> minding only the fleſh, as you Miſſalians doe, though the fleſh alone profits nothing: alleaging how his ſacramentall words were ſpirituall: The fleſh ſaith he, profits nothing: but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quickens. As alſo, O Miſſalians, how can you religiouſly accord your tranſubſtantiation with the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, which promiſeth and aſſureth eternall life to thoſe, that ſhall eate his fleſh, and drinke his blood, if you conceive theſe words carnally? For you cannot be ignorant, but that your owne bodies when they have devoured theſe round tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated hoſts into fleſh and bones, drunke and taken downe the tranſubſtantiated wine into blood, notwithſtanding live &amp; are mortal through the neceſſity of the law. Wherefore eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life promiſed by this communion, cannot be underſtood by a mortall body, or fleſh. And therefore of neceſſity you muſt needs acknowledge, for the moſt ſacred interpretation, that to eate the body and drinke the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, muſt have reference to a ſpirituall and heavenly life: and that the fleſh profits nothing, but the ſpirituall words; &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, by faith and ſpirit give eternall life. This interpretation is many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> when Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe uſeth theſe words, Hee that comes to mee, ſhall never hunger; he that beleeves in me ſhall never feele thirſt, but have eternall life. Are not theſe termes intelligible enough, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8021:44"/>this holy ſacrament of the communion of the body &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt, without running to your magick of tranſubſtantiation?</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8021:53"/>I take it that was the cauſe they did not ſuppreſſe it, as they did others. For <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> doth ſhew there, how they have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of ſome of the Latin ſermons, which are to be ſeen in thoſe of the Saxon tongue, and thence he doth ſhew that they were ſuch words, as made againſt their ſuperſtition: So it is manifeſt that this doctrine of Tranſubſtantion was not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Churches of England for fifty years after, for this book of conſtitutions was in uſe till <hi>Langfrank</hi> was Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, &amp; it doth appeare that ſermon was read in thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches untill <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour came into England, &amp; had raigned there ſome years, in likely hood till the year 1070. &amp; <hi>Capgrave</hi> and <hi>William Mamsbery,</hi> who were Hiſtory writers, doe both of them affirm, that this <hi>Alfricus</hi> was Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> about the year 996.

            <p>Thus was the manner of the Popiſh Prieſts thus to deprave, wher it is certain by that before rehearſed, &amp; this herafter teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that this was the judgment of the Church: &amp; the reaſons he uſed to ſhew what made them alter their mindes are certain falſe miracles, which are common in their Legendaries, &amp; may be read in the forenamed Hiſtory, which if I ſhould rehearſe would be thought lying for the Whetſtone.</p>

The ſecond cauſe is, becauſe they are more generall, for there is almoſt no land in which this ſect doth not creepe. The third cauſe is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all other ſects, do bring a horrour, with the haynouſneſſe of their blaſphemies againſt God: but this ſecte of the <hi>Lione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> hath a great ſhewe of godlynes, becauſe they live juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and they beleeve all things well concerning God, &amp; they beleeve all the Articles, which are contayned in the Creede. They blaſpheme and hate only the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is to be found in a little Treatiſe of <hi>Renerius,</hi> imprinted neere a hundred yeares ſince. Who was a bloody Inquiſitour, and gave ſentence of death againſt ſundry of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ieſuite</hi> ſaith, that one <hi>Ceſarius</hi> writes, that the Doctrine of theſe <hi>Waldenſes</hi> was ſpread in more then a thouſand cities,<note place="margin">In a booke againſt <hi>Foxe</hi> 535. fol.</note> and that they had an army of 70000. that were deſtroyed by <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Momford,</hi> with a ſmall armie: but there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an armie, which they had in the Cronicles.</p>
            <p>Now we will ſhewe what the hereſie was for which they were perſecuted, as <hi>Langfrank</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>That the ſacrifice of the Church conſiſteth of two things, the one viſible, the other inviſible, that is, of the Sacrament, &amp; the the thing or matter of the Sacrament, which is the body of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8021:56"/>Chriſt, if it were here preſent before our eyes, it were a thing viſible, and to be ſeene; but being lift up to Heaven, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the right hand of his Father, to the time of reſtoring of all things, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. It can not be called downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, for the perſon of Chriſt conſiſteth of God and man. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Table, conſiſteth of bread and wine, which being conſecrated, are not changed but remaine in their ſubſtances, having a reſemblance or ſimilitude of thoſe things, whereof they be Sacraments. See <hi>Langfrank.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed how this abhominable doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crept into the church, &amp; that it was hatched by the Monks, &amp; by the Hiſtories wee may ſee how they confirmed it with miracles, and their holy biſhop <hi>Duaſton</hi> did triumph over the Divell, when hee would have enticed him to luſt after a young Woman. Hee got the Divell by the noſe with a pair of red not tongs. Such like miracles are to be read in their Legend.</p>
            <p>Another miracle of a lewiſh Boy,<note place="margin">For which teſtimonie he was putt into the fire to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his Father, but the fire had no power to touch him, for a beautifull woman, whoſe the Child was, kept the ſire from him with her gown And this was the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine <hi>Marie.</hi>
               </note> that ſaid, hee ſaw in the Church of the Chriſtians a Child broken and divided.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the Papiſts, do affirme, that the Church of Chriſt did in all ages teach Tranſubſtantiation to be a Catholike doctrine: We will examine one of their Hiſtorie-writers, who wrote in the time this idole was a hatching, called <hi>Oſbon,</hi> who did write the lives of three Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about the yeare 1076. in which Hiſtorie hee ſaith: In the dayes of <hi>Odo,</hi> certaine of the Clergy being ſeduced by wicked error, did hould and maintaine, that the bread and wine, which are ſet upon the Altar, after the conſecration, do remaine in their former ſubſtance, &amp; are but only a figure of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt: But (ſaith hee) that holy Father <hi>Odo</hi> did convert them, which was about the yeare 951. Hee reciteth the means which <hi>Odo</hi> did uſe, to convert them by a certaine miracle. Hee ſaith: Theſe Clergie Men being before him, hee perſwaded them, ſeeing they could not be convicted by argument, yet he requeſted them, to ſtay and ſee him ſay Maſſe, &amp; to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, which they did, &amp; ſeeing, after conſecration &amp; breaking of the Hoſte over the chalice, the blood dropped out of the Hoſte into the chalice <hi>Odo.</hi> (ſaith hee) wept for joy to ſee his petition accompliſhed, which hee ſo carneſtly prayed for. On
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8021:57"/>the ſight thereof, he ſaith: theſe clergie men behoulding and ſeeing were converted, and bleſſed the Archbiſhop, thanking God that he was borne to manifeſt his truth to them, and thus they were converted to beleeve Tranſubſtantiation, and bleſſed the Archbiſhop for their converſion, and they deſired him to pray againe that it might returne to the former ſubſtance, and preſently he returned it into the ſame ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>Now I would gladly know what was the reaſon, that after this great miracle, and the converſion of this clergie, that this contrarie Doctrine ſhould be taught, and that an Archbiſhop <hi>Alfrecus</hi> ſhould tranſlate and write againſt this miracle &amp; doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and that all the Churches in England ſhould with him teach againſt this Tranſubſtantation, and that for 90. yeares, if not for a hundred, and yet ſhould not be excommunicated by the holy Father the Pope, &amp; not once proceeded againſt, ſeeing that 60. yeares after, the clergie of England made a booke of conſtitutions to be governed by, in which they did all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that in the Lords Supper, there remained bread &amp; wine, and yet the faithfull receaved Chriſt ſpiritually, and yet for all this the Pope did not proceede againſt them.</p>
            <p>Againe what was the reaſon, there were ſo many Latine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons tolerated in the Church, which taught againſt their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and they not condemned by ſome generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for hereſie, if the Church had formerly concluded this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Againe what is the reaſon that theſe Latine Sermons are all made away, except one, and that that ſhould have ſome words utterly razed out, &amp; the ſame Sermon remaining in the Saxon language, hath theſe words: Notwithſtanding this ſacrifice is not the ſame body of his, wherein he ſuffered for us, nor the ſame blood of his, which hee ſhed for us,<note place="margin">Anno <hi>1141.</hi>
               </note> but ſpiritually it is made his body and blood, as that Manna, which rained from heaven, &amp; the water, which did flow out of the Rock, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. Theſe words ſo razed out are reſtored againe by the ſame ſermon in the Saxon language, and is to be ſeene in a booke at <hi>Exeter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe I marvell thoſe clergie men were ſuffred to be ſo
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8021:58"/>neare the Biſhop at his celebrating of <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and were not rather committed to ward like hereticks.</p>
            <p>Againe I marvell that this <hi>Odo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popiſh Writer found falſh.</note> hee being a man of ſo great authoritie, who had ſuch extraordinary gifts in working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as never any Prophet or Apoſtle had, yet that he would ſuffer thoſe Latine ſermons in the Church, which <hi>Alfrecus</hi> did tranſlate 46. yeares after him into the Saxon language, and not he to have ſo much as writ againſt them, and that hereſie, and to leave ſome teſtimonie of his deteſtation againſt it.</p>
            <p>Againe I do marvell that <hi>Oſbon</hi> doth not make mention of their ſinging <hi>to Deum,</hi> ſeeing it was in the Cathedrall Church, where ſo many ſinging men were.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> who can cleare theſe Doubts ſhall do as great a miracle, as <hi>Odo</hi> did, when by his prayers cauſed a ſword to come flying from heaven into King Ethelſtanes ſcabard, when he had loſt his owne, and he being in fight with <hi>Analnus.</hi> Or as great a miracle as <hi>Odo</hi> did, in making that all the time the roofe of the Chuch of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was a building, hee cauſed that not one drop of raine fell in the Church, nay that <hi>Ieſuite</hi> deſerveth a Cardinals hat.</p>
            <p>All theſe reaſons well conſidered, do ſhewe that this <hi>Oſbon</hi> did ſeeke to delude the people, and his teſtimonie is found to be againſt them, and to manifeſt the truth for us.</p>
            <p>And this Doctrine was not eſtabliſhed by generall conſent, till <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. by the counſell holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 1215. It was by 1300, Biſhops, and there they did decree, that all muſt goe to confeſſion once a yeare, and come to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and this was made an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>About the year of our Lord 1280. lived <hi>Iohannes Scotus,</hi> he is called Downes, he was Maſter of Sciences, &amp; in his 4. book he writes thus of the ſacrament of the Lords Supper, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be expounded more eaſily &amp; more planely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tranſubſtantiation, but the Church did chooſe this ſence, which is more hard being moved thereunto, as it ſeemeth chiefly becauſe of the Sacrament, men ought to hold as the holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame place, he doth allude unto <hi>Jnnocent</hi> the 3.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8021:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the counſell holden in the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> called the Laterane counſell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on the 1. Corinth. 7. ſaith: The Church of Chriſt hath lately determined Tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament, it was enough a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſeaſon to beleeve Chriſts body to be either under the bread conſecrated, or els to be preſent after any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, this he wrote about an 120. yeares ſince. He was as great a learned man, as any lived in that age.</p>
            <p>This Pope having (as it is manifeſted) altered the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, he having ordained a new faith, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving choſen 4. orders of Fryers, which brought forth a new Goſpel, called <hi>Cirillus,</hi> by which they taught that God gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the time of the Law, the Sone in the time of grace, but now by the comming of the 4. orders of begging Fryers, the Holy Ghoſt began to raigne, and ſhould raigne till the end of the world, and thoſe which beleeved this new Goſpell, ſhould be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And if the Lord in mercy had not ſtirred up many witneſſes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13</note> to withſtand there croaking frogs, they would have razed out all Chriſtianity, amongſt which was that famous divine <hi>Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmus,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> who proved by 39. Arguments, that fryers are falſe teachers, and all the Scriptures, which are againſt Antichriſt, hee applyed againſt them. See more in <hi>Mr. Fox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. came to be Pope Anno 1198. Hee was Pope 19. yeares, and he having brought in many ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the Chuch: Hee commanded <hi>Almericum</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> to be burned for an hereticke, becauſe he diſallowed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and that whoſoever did not goe to confeſſion at leaſt once a yeare, ſhould be excommunicate. He ordained the Lords Supper ſhould be celebrated without wine: he ordained that the conſecrated Hoſte ſhould be carryed to the ſick by the Prieſt in a gorgeous habit, with torches or candles light, and a bell before him, and ſo to goe to the ſick, and give him of it.</p>
            <p>It is recorded, this Pope was exceeding ſubtile and crafty, he brought the Emperour under him, and all the Kings in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, as <hi>Abas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpergincs</hi> ſaith. Hee gott all the wealth in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8021:59"/>world by his wicked deviſes.<note place="margin">He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled king <hi>Iohn</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Crown of him. See <hi>Fox</hi> 253.</note> Hee decreed, that whoſever ſpake evill of the Pope, ſhould looſe his life, yea that hee ſhould be tormented in hell ſire.</p>
            <p>This Pope did firſt inſtitute the fowr orders of Fryers. wheras the order of Monks were made firſt clergy men by <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, in a counſell at <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 610. There it was decreed that the Moncks might preach and baptiſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and abſolve, whereas before they did not attend any ſuch office:<note place="margin">See <hi>Vencenee Belovanſes</hi> Hiſt. lib. 30.</note> and it doth appeare, that the Prieſts did much oppoſe them. For I doe find, that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> after did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them to thoſe degrees.</p>
            <p>To returne to this <hi>Innocentius,</hi> there he did ordain, that the foreſaid Fryers ſhould refort to all houſes, and that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received from him power to teach, to binde or to looſe all which they ſhould judge of, and thus they kept the people in great feare of them.<note place="margin">Anno. <hi>259.</hi>
               </note> Hee ordained, that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> ſhould be received with equal authority, as if it had proceeded from the Euangeliſts or Apoſtles themſelvs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Popiſh orders of theſe croaking frogs were not leſie then an hundreth ſorts of them, and they were in all parts of Chriſtendom, not one village was free of them, and theſe were eſtabliſhed to ſuppreſſe the hereticks, as they did accompt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

            <p>And of theſe falſe teaching Fryers there needs no farther or clearer teſtimonie for their conviction, then the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that <hi>Hildigardis</hi> foretold of them, and her teſtimonie touching them, is void of exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince they hold hir for a Propheteſſe: ſhe prophecyed firſt againſt the Prelates and Prieſts, charging

            <p>Ye have built your neſts on high indeed, and when ye could riſe up no higher, ye fell down like as did <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> whom God deſtroyed &amp; ſmote with a mighty plagne; So ſhall you alſo be thrown down uppon the earth out of the clouds, and that by meanes of your falſe doctrine, your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, lies, ſlanders, and deteſtable facts.

And ſeeing that you would needs aſcend up higher then was meete and equall, ye are fallen backe headlong into everlaſting ſhame and reproch by Gods juſt judgment.</p>
            <p>Theſe things wrote <hi>Hildegard</hi> about the yeare 1146.</p>
            <p>It is recorded, that the people were ſo oppreſt with them, that they make ſuite that their number might be leſſe, for they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8021:61"/>were not able no maintain them all, for they kept the people in feare of them, ſo that they durſt not diſpleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for if they did, they would excommunicate them, or els accuſe them to be hereticks, &amp; thoſe that did obey them, they would flatter, &amp; tell them they would pray and prevaile with the Saincts, that they ſhould not be tormented in Purgatory. And if they were rich, &amp; lay ſick on their death-bed, then they would perſwade them to give to their order and houſe at leaſt a childs portion, that they might not be tormented in purgatory, yea if they gave liberally, they would promiſe them their ſoules ſhould goe preſently into Paradice, and thus they did beguile the ſimple people, and defrand their poſterity of their inheritance; ſo that in leſſe then 400. years they had gott the third part of the wealth in the world.</p>
            <p>To the like effect alſo prophecyed <hi>Catharine,</hi> whom they have canonized for a Sainct. She affirmed that all their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were deceivers of the people, and perverters of the truth.</p>
            <p>And holy <hi>Bridget</hi> did affirme, that moſt of the Popes were in Hell torments, for their deceaving the people, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truth of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>This Pope ſent his Legate into <hi>France</hi> with 12. Abbotts, to ſuppreſſe the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which taught the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Whore of Babylon, and his ordinances wicked, and their <hi>Maſse</hi> full of abhomination, contrary to Chriſt and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and never known to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And this Pope did firſt inſtitute an inquiſition, which did condemn the poore lambs for hereticks, &amp; the like they did in <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; appointed <hi>Diedicus</hi> a Biſhop there, who did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them with all cruelty.

            <p>For the confidence of juſtifying faith, is a motion of the will and heart, conſiſting of a joy conceived for the certainly of the preſent grace of God toward him, and of the Hope of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture delivery from all evils.</p>
            <p>There is no faith, but that, which reſteth on the will of God, revealed in his word.</p>
            <p>All true faith is wrought in man by the Holy Ghoſt, either by the voice of Gods heavenly Doctrine, or by his imediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and ſeeing God will kindle, frame, and confirme or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary faith in us, by the Doctrine of the Church, all are bound to heare it, and meditate theron.</p>
            <p>Faith alwayes in the ellect, is imperfect in this life, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time languiſheth, yet howſoever, he feeleth in his heart an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8021:64"/>againſt doubts, which ariſe in his minde, yet he doth certainly reſolve, hee is indued with true faith.</p>
            <p>This true faith, being once kindled in our hearts: although often it languiſheth, and is darkened for a time, yet it is never wholy extinguiſhed; for by faith onely we apply the promiſes of grace, and we obtaine the promiſes of grace, receiving righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes before God and the participation or communion of Chriſt, with all his benefits.</p>
            <p>Soe true faith is the perſwaſion of the heart, whereby the ſoule is truely aſſured of redemption, and remiſſion of ſinnes, and imputation of righteouſnes through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let us hereto obſerve what our Saviour ſaith:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.</note> Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, but he which doeth the will of my Father, which is in Heaven. And hereto ſaith the Apoſtle: Make an end of your ſalvation with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> What availeth it my Brethren, if a man ſaith, he have faith, when he hath no works:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Iemes</hi> 2.14.</note> can that faith ſave him? That is, it cannot ſave him.</p>
            <p>All which have this true faith, doe daily judge &amp; examine themſelves of thoſe ſinnes, they have fallen into, and they are truely ſorye for them, &amp; they doe humbly beſeech the Lord, not onely for pardon, but they doe inſtantly begge of him for ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his grace, that he may ſubdue his naturall corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which is an eſpeciall worke of true faith: &amp; therefore Chriſt ſaith: Come unto me all ye, which labour and are laden,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 29</note> and I will eaſe you.</p>
            <p>For all which have the ſpirit of regeneration, doe not allow that which they doe, for they labour to doe that, which they are unable to performe, therefore they doe as little Children doe, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Father bids, bring them ſomthing they are unable to doe, and performe, yet if the Child doe his beſt to doe it: his father doth accept it as well, if he had performed it. So is it betwixt us and the Lord, if we ſubdue our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be ſory for our faults, and be earneſtly ſueing to the throne of grace, for ſtrength of his Spirit, that we may ſubdue them, then are we thoſe Chriſt ſpeake of: Bleſſed are thoſe,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8021:65"/>which mourne for they ſhalbe comforted. If wee have theſe effects, then are we thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, ſaying: He which is borne of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9.</note> ſinneth not.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this, cauſed the Apoſtle to charge the ſervants of God, to mortify their luſts, becauſe the time is come that judgement doth begin at the houſe of God. And he ſaith: If it doe beginne with us, what ſhall the end be of thoſe, which obey not the Goſpell of God, for if the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appeare?</p>
            <p>For if Chriſt raigne not in our hearts, then hee is not our Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27</note> therefore hee ſaith: Thoſe mine enimies, which will not have me raigne over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. For every tree, which bringeth not forth good fruite, ſhalbe hewen downe, and caſt into the fire.</p>
            <p>Thus I have pointed at the true juſtifying faith, which the ancient Church did maintaine: But if I ſhould explicate it, it would require a quyer of paper to manifeſt it. But I haſten to other things.</p>

            <p>From his owne affirmation I conclude their Church is falſe by reaſon their faith was not knowne the firſt thouſand years, nay nor till <hi>Jnnocent</hi> the 3. who was the firſt Father of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were ſundry Popes before him in hatching it 250. yeares, yet was it not brought forth, till the Counſell of <hi>Latteran</hi> A<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1215. where there was decreed ſundry other ſuperſtitions, and as I have before ſhewed a new faith was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, which <hi>Langfrank</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did hatch, and bring forth againſt <hi>Baringaris.</hi>

            <p>And to this end, I will ſhew what three of the Fathers have written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about one hundreth yeares after, ſaith: That the faith of Chriſt was received in the raigne of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of the <hi>Medes, Perſians, Meſſapotanians, Iurie, Cappadocia,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaking of the multitude, which fled out of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> upon the perſecution, when <hi>Steven</hi> was put to death, ſaith: That the faith of Chriſt did ſpread over all the world, by the multitude of them, which fled.</p>
            <p>And <hi>St. Paul</hi> wrote to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> about 21. years after, &amp; hee ſaith: The faith of Chriſt was publiſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world, which was before <hi>Peter</hi> came at <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>And it doth appeare that thoſe, which planted the Goſpell in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> came not from the Romaine Church, becauſe they did ſo much diſſent in ceremonies, for the obſervation of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter day,</hi> which is one of the ancienteſt traditions, they did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> 700. yeares, and although <hi>Austine</hi> the Monk did corrupt the Church with the Romane ſuperſtitions, yet hee was oppoſed by many learned <hi>Brittaines,</hi> and they ſent unto <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to confer with him concerning their differences, &amp; they did agree to have a meeting where <hi>Auſtine</hi> came with his learned men; and the Brittaine Churches ſent thither one <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> with 7.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8021:66"/>that they did ſo contend, and ſtrive in this contention, that there was blood-ſhed in this aſſembly, upon which <hi>Auſtine</hi> did threaten to ſtirre up warres againſt them; the which wee find hee did, and cauſed many to be murthered, and although hee prevailed againſt them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi> in folio 131. <hi>Anno</hi> 798.</note> yet <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> doth ſhew, that when <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> did ſend into England to the King &amp; Biſhops and Nobility for to receive the Romane ceremonies &amp; Images in the Churches, they appointed <hi>Albinus</hi> to anſwer it, which hee did, &amp; when he had anſwered it, they did well approve of it, &amp; ſent it with the booke to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this <hi>Albinus</hi> to go to him with it.</p>
            <p>And howſoever it hath ſince prevailed,<note place="margin">See the Chronicle of <hi>Panlus Meriall.

            <p>But it is objected, <hi>Foxes</hi> booke is a booke of lyes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be credited.

            <p>And their Hiſtories doe ſhew, thus they dealt in moſte parts of Chriſtendom, between the years 610. and 800. And then they doe write, they were converted to the faith of the Roman Church, whereas it is certain they perverted the faith, for by the teſtimonie of Hiſtories, the faith of Chriſt was profeſſed in thoſe Countryes long before, as I have partly related.</p>
            <p>I have alledged ſome Fathers here, to ſhew how it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that they have given teſtimony unto the truth, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Again whatſoever things brought in by any, although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe holy and learned ſince the Apoſtles, let it be cutt of and have no place, on the 86. Pſalm.</p>

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> None can prejudice the truth, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of times, nor the ſuperiority of perſons, nor the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Countryes, for by means of theſe is cuſtome made commonly of ignorance; and ſucceſſion of time, made ſtrong to be uſed againſt the truth. Chriſt our Lord calleth himſelfe <hi>Truth,</hi> not <hi>cuſtome.</hi> If then Chriſt be allwaies and before all, the <hi>Truth</hi> then it is a thing perpetuall and ancient.

            <p>Again he ſaith: As for us we may not pleaſe ourſelvs in any thing of our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits, neither may we chooſe that, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bring in of their own Will. The Apoſtles of the Lord we have for Authours, who did not themſelvs chooſe to bring-in any thing of their own will, but did faithfully aſſigne to the Nations the diſcipline they received of Chriſt, therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though an Angell from Heaven ſhould ſpeak otherwiſe, wee ſhould ſay he were accurſed. <hi>Ibid. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
